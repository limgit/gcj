Google Code Jam - My Practices and Answers

### Notes
  * There are two types of source files: file with name containing "Practice" (ex. 2017 Qualification Practice A) and the others (ex. 2017 Qualification B). 
    * The former one is an answer source file for the problem. It is solved after the contest (in practice mode).
    * The latter one is a solve trial source file for the problem. It was written during the contest, and may solve the problem. The status of solving is written in **README.md** of each directory.
  * The source file that does not contain a logic for solving problem is not added to this repository
    * For example, empty files, the file that only contains file I/O for reading problem, etc.
